# IT Job Fair Theme

## WordPress Theme
This WordPress theme was part of a larger project to build a WordPress site for my college's annual IT Job Fair, featuring a custom theme, managing event registrations, and custom admin pages for visualizing and exporting registration data. The theme was tailored to the branding and functional requirements of the IT Job Fair, and also holds shortcode files for the admin reporting functionality.

## Features
- Index: The main template file for the theme outputting the structure for the pages starting with the header, title, content, page changes, and footer.
- Functions: The central file for adding custom functionality, where all shortcodes are registered, enqueue scripts and styles, and adding custom hooks.
- Styles: Includes styles for both the public-facing site, and admin pages as necessary.
- Toggle Agenda: Custom JavaScript to handle interactive elements on the site, such as toggling the agenda section on the front page.
- Responsive: Using Bootstrap to make all pages responsive and friendly for all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- WordPress 6.5
- PHP 8.3
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- HTML5

  ## Lessons Learned
  - Understanding the WordPress API.
  - Shortcodes for dynamic content insertion and reusability.
  - Custom hooks, making the theme more modular and better integration of functionalities without rewriting core logic.
  - Admin pages for reports, understanding the admin area architecture, using shortcodes, and CSV capabilities.
  - Integration with plugins and what aspects of the WP site to include in the theme or to create a custom plugin.

## Future Improvements 
- Enhanced Custom Shortcodes: More customizable parameters and integrating into reusable blocks within the WP block editor.
- Custom Gutenberg Blocks: Build custom Gutenberg blocks instead of relying solely on shortcodes. This would provide a more visual, user-friendly experience for content editors, allowing them to drag and drop elements like event schedules directly into pages.
- Report Customization: Allow admins to generate custom reports by adding filters for registration data.
- Accessibility (WCAG Compliance): Ensure the theme meets web accessibility standards by improving keyboard navigation, adding ARIA roles to custom elements, and optimizing color contrast.
